Messing Arround with Quickbooks and django.
===========================================

I have one integration that is based on com32, but it is only one way communication and you need to have the software on
the same same computer to talk with it. it is ugly and old.

I want something new that I can talk to quickbooks via the webconnector and maybe online version.
